Current Features Implemented (02/23/2021)
Fresh Potatoes web application now contains a fully operated login and registered 
system. The system is able to store a user's username and password as they registered
to become one of the members of Fresh Potatoes. Furthermore, a profile feature 
has been implemented for each user who registered. Any changes or updates on users 
profile information will be saved and presented every time they login.
Following the current progression speed of the project, the homepage for unregistered
users is completed along with login, register, and profile pages. The body of 
the homepage has been seperated into 4 sections with one featured movie at the top 
and 3 categorized columns of movie showcases beneath. The 3 columns of movies are 
listed as popular movies, trending movies, and upcoming movies for unregistered users.
Every movie present in the homepage is directly pulled from a third party database
using application programming interface.
The application programming interface that is introduced in our project is TMDb. In
current progress, we are able to retrieve movie information including movie genres,
poster, overview, and details including title, rating, budget, popularity, production
and more. More API features require further research and implementation.
